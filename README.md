# Splinear
A 2D/3D drawing and animation tool


## Dependencies
Uses a mixture of OpenGL and OpenCL, with GLEW and GLFW as assistants. Requires installation of the following libraries.

`$ sudo apt install nvidia-opencl-dev libgl1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libglew-dev`

Extra configuration may be necessary for platforms aside from Linux.

List of dependencies:
- OpenGL
- OpenCL 2.2 or great
- GLFW3
- GLEW
- pthread

## Build and Run
This uses a makefile. Simply sit in the main directory that this README is located in, and run the commands:

`$ make`
`$ make run`

The rest should be taken care of.

## Configuration
Program configurations can be modified and set inside of [config.h](/src/config.h). Currently only allows for configuration of window resolution and debug mode.
